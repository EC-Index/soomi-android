# SOOMI Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2024**

## Our Commitment

SOOMI is built with privacy as a core principle. We believe parents should be able to use technology to help their babies sleep without worrying about surveillance or data collection.

## What SOOMI Does NOT Do

- ❌ **Does NOT record audio** - Audio is processed in real-time and immediately discarded
- ❌ **Does NOT store raw audio** - Only aggregated metrics are saved
- ❌ **Does NOT upload audio** - No audio data ever leaves your device
- ❌ **Does NOT use camera** - No camera permissions requested
- ❌ **Does NOT track location** - No location permissions requested
- ❌ **Does NOT require internet** - Works fully offline
- ❌ **Does NOT share data** - Your data stays on your device

## What SOOMI DOES Store (Locally)

To help you track progress and improve over time, SOOMI stores the following **on your device only**:

### Session Data
- Session start/end times
- Baseline mode selected
- Number of unrest events
- Total soothing time
- Peak unrest score (a number, not audio)

### Downsampled Metrics
- Unrest score every 3-5 seconds (a single number 0-100)
- State transitions (e.g., "Baseline → Soothing")

### Your Feedback
- Morning check-in responses
- Notes you write

### Learning Data
- Which intervention types worked best
- Success rates by sound type and baseline mode

**None of this data includes raw audio.**

## Optional Telemetry

If you choose to enable telemetry (OFF by default), SOOMI may collect:

- Anonymous session statistics (duration, events, effectiveness)
- Feature usage patterns
- App crashes and errors

**Telemetry NEVER includes:**
- Audio recordings
- Personal information
- Location data
- Device identifiers that can identify you

### How to Control Telemetry

1. Go to Settings
2. Find "Help SOOMI improve"
3. Toggle OFF (default) or ON

You can change this anytime, and disabling telemetry immediately stops collection.

## Data Retention

- All data is stored locally on your device
- You can delete all data by uninstalling the app
- Old session data (>90 days) is automatically cleaned up

## Children's Privacy

SOOMI processes audio from the environment, which may include sounds from children. However:

- No audio is recorded or stored
- No data about the child is collected
- The app cannot identify individuals
- Processing happens entirely on-device

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Know what data is collected (this policy)
- Access your data (visible in the app's Progress screen)
- Delete your data (uninstall the app)
- Opt out of telemetry (in Settings)

## Security

- All data stored locally with Android's standard security
- No network transmission unless telemetry enabled
- No third-party SDKs with tracking capabilities

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as SOOMI evolves. Significant changes will be communicated through app updates.

**Summary: SOOMI processes audio to detect baby sounds and play soothing sounds. No audio is ever recorded or uploaded. All data stays on your device unless you explicitly opt in to anonymous telemetry.**
